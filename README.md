# Python_Sales_Analysis
Python project for beginners- Analyze sales data to improve customer experience and sales

We take a Csv file data and perform data cleaning and manipulation for better and optimised data.
Using various python libraries like numpy pandas matplotlib and seaborn we made data vizualisations in Jupyter Notebook using Python and create data insights.

SUMMARY AND RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS---

From graphs we can see that most of the buyers are females and even the purchasing power of females are greater than men.

There are more customers in the young age group of 18-25 and 25-36 thus confirming the youth presence of products in the market.
State-wise product sales also provide insight of product hit in different states.
